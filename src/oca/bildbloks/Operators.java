    Java operators are not necessarily evaluated from left-to-right order
    Unless overridden with parentheses, Java operators follow order of operation
    If two operators have the same level of precedence, then Java guarantees left-to-right evaluation
    All of the arithmetic operators may be applied to any Java primitives, except boolean and String
