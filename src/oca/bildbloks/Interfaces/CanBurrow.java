/**Defining an Interface
 1. Interfaces cannot be instantiated directly.
 2. An interface is not required to have any methods.
 3. An interface may not be marked as final .
 4. All top-level interfaces are assumed to have public or default access, and they must include the abstract
        modifier in their definition. Therefore, marking an interface as  private ,
        protected , or final will trigger a compiler error, since this is incompatible with these assumptions.
 5. All nondefault methods in an interface are assumed to have the modifiers abstract and public in their definition.
        Therefore, marking a method as private , protected , or final will trigger compiler errors
        as these are incompatible with the abstract and public keywords.
