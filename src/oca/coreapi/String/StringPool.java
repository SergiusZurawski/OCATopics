  String pool == internall pool - location in the Java virtual machine (JVM)
 that collects all these strings.

    The string pool contains literal values that appear in your program.
        For example,
            “name” is a literal - string pool.
            myObject.toString() is a string but not a literal, so it doesn't go into string pool.
